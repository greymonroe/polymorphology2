#' Rank-based Inverse Normal Transformation (INT)
#'
#' This function applies a rank-based inverse normal transformation (INT) to a vector of data, transforming it to follow an approximate normal distribution.
#' INT is often used to handle non-normal, skewed data by transforming it into a form suitable for statistical analyses requiring normality.
#'
#' @param x A numeric vector of data values to be transformed.
#' @return A numeric vector of transformed values, approximately normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
#' @details The function ranks the data, converts ranks to probabilities, and then applies the inverse normal cumulative distribution function.
#' INT is a common preprocessing step in genetics and other fields where traits may not follow a normal distribution.
#'
#' This transformation technique is particularly useful in rare-variant association testing where phenotypic outliers and non-normality can affect the analysis (Auer, Reiner, & Leal, 2016).
